# Next.js + MongoDB

Deploy a Next.js and Mongo application and learn how to host backend code on Code Capsules.

## Setup

Code Capsules connects to GitHub repositories to deploy applications. To follow this guide, you'll need a [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io/) account and a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

To demonstrate how to deploy a Next.js MongoDB application with Code Capsules, we've provided an example application, which you can find on the [Code Capsules GitHub repository](https://github.com/codecapsules-io/demo-next-mongodb-api).

Sign in to GitHub, and fork the example application by clicking **Fork** at the top-right of your screen and selecting your GitHub account as the destination.

## Create a Space for Your App

Log in to your Code Capsules account and navigate to the Spaces tab. Once there, click the yellow `+` icon on the bottom left of the screen to add a new Space.

Follow the prompts, choosing your region and giving your Space a name, then click **Create Space**.

1. Choose a Team — you can use a default **personal** Team if you're the only person working on this project, or a named Team if you're collaborating with others
2. This should remind you of the project, for example, **customer-api** or **notetaking-app**
3. Choose a country close to where most of your users will be

## Create the Capsule

A [Capsule](/platform/capsules/what-is-a-capsule) provides the server for hosting an application on Code Capsules.

Navigate to the **Capsules** tab. Once there, click the yellow `+` icon on the bottom left of the screen to add a new Capsule.

To create a new Data Capsule for your Space, follow the instructions below:

1. Choose **MongoDB**, your Team, and Space.
2. Choose your payment plan.
3. Click **Create Capsule**.

Navigate to the Space containing your recently created Data Capsule and click the yellow `+` icon on the bottom left of the screen. Follow the instructions below to create a Backend Capsule:

1. Choose **Backend Capsule**, your Team, and Space.
2. Choose your payment plan.
3. Click the GitHub button and give access to the repository you forked at the start of the tutorial.
4. Choose the GitHub repository you forked.
5. Press **Next**.
6. Leave **Run Command** blank.
7. Click **Create Capsule**.

Code Capsules will automatically build your application when you've finished creating the Capsule. While the build is in progress, you can view the log by clicking **View Build Progress** next to the **Building Capsule** message.

Once your application is live, you can view the build log by selecting the **Deploy** tab and clicking the **View build log** link in the **Builds** section.

## Connect the Capsules

After the two capsules have been successfully built, the next step is to connect them. To do this, navigate to the **Config** tab of your Backend Capsule. Scroll down to the **Data Capsule** section and click **View** to view the environment variables from the Data Capsule. Click the `+` next to the `Connection string` variable to create a `DATABASE_URL` environmental variable in your Backend Capsule, which gives access to services and features of your Data Capsule.

## View Application

Once the build is complete, click the **URL** link in the **Config** tab, and you should see your deployed application.
