# How to Create and Host a Node.js Telegram Bot on Code Capsules


_This guide uses Node.js. You can find the Python version_ [_here_](/tutorials/how-to-create-and-host-a-telegram-bot-on-code-capsules) _or the Go version_ [_here_](/tutorials/create-and-host-go-ai-telegram-bot).

In this tutorial, we'll extend a boilerplate Express application on Code Capsules to create a Telegram bot in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) that tracks and responds with current Ethereum prices.

### Getting Started

Navigate to the [Express.js deployment guide](/backend/node.js/express.js) and follow the instructions outlined there to deploy the boilerplate application. You will need to clone the forked repository to your local development environment to extend the functionality of the boilerplate application and make a Telegram bot.

We need to install the `node_modules` for the boilerplate application, before we can run it locally. Navigate to the project's root folder in a terminal or command prompt window and run `npm install` there.

Now you can run `npm start` in the project from its root folder to see how the application looks.

### Register a Bot Account

You'll need a Telegram user account before you can create a Telegram bot. Head over to [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and create an account if you don't already have one.

When you've signed in to Telegram, search for "BotFather" (a bot for managing all other Telegram bots) and start a new chat with it. Follow the steps below to register a new bot with the BotFather:

1. Type `/start` and press send.
2. Type `/newbot` and press send.
3. Choose a name for your bot.
4. Choose a username for your bot that ends in `bot`.

The BotFather will respond with a message containing an access token for your newly created bot. This access token will allow our application to access the Telegram API and tell our bot what to do when receiving different messages from users.

To confirm that your bot was created successfully, search for the bot's username. You should be able to see it and start a conversation with it, although it won't respond as we haven't written the bot's logic yet.

### Set Up the Development Environment

Your bot's access token is sensitive data and shouldn't be written in the code because anyone with access to your token can control your bot, so it's important to store it where it's safe and secure. The solution is to use environment variables to reference sensitive information in code.

Create a `.env` file in the project's root folder and add the line below to it, replacing `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with the actual access token you were issued by the BotFather:

```
BOT_TOKEN=<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>
```

Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file on a new line so that the `.env` file won't be uploaded to your remote repository when you push your changes.

### Install Required Packages

Next, install the package for loading environment variables by running the command below from a terminal window in the project's root folder:

```
npm install dotenv
```

Also install the `axios` and `telegraf` packages by running the commands listed below from a terminal window in the project's root folder:

```
npm install axios
npm install telegraf
```

### Create the Bot Logic

Open `index.js` in the root folder and modify its contents with the code below:

```js
const express = require('express')
const expressApp = express()
const axios = require("axios");
const path = require("path")
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
expressApp.use(express.static('static'))
expressApp.use(express.json());
require('dotenv').config();

const { Telegraf } = require('telegraf');

const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);

expressApp.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/index.html'));
});

bot.launch()
```

The code snippet above instantiates `express`, `axios` and `telegraf` objects, which we'll need to create the telegram bot. Notice how we use environment variables to reference our bot's access token in this line: `const bot = new Telegraf(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);`.

Using the `bot.launch()` command isn't efficient from a bandwidth perspective, as our bot continuously polls the Telegram API to check if it has received any new messages. Later in the tutorial, we will look at how to use webhooks in order to be more conservative with the bandwidth our bot uses.

### Add Bot Commands

Now it's time to add the logic for the commands that tell our bot how to respond to different messages. Add the code below to `index.js` just above the `bot.launch()` line:

```js
bot.command('start', ctx => {
  console.log(ctx.from)
  bot.telegram.sendMessage(ctx.chat.id, 'Hello there! Welcome to the Code Capsules telegram bot.\nI respond to /ethereum. Please try it', {
  })
})

bot.command('ethereum', ctx => {
  var rate;
  console.log(ctx.from)
  axios.get(`https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=ethereum&vs_currencies=usd`)
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data)
    rate = response.data.ethereum
    const message = `Hello, today the ethereum price is ${rate.usd}USD`
    bot.telegram.sendMessage(ctx.chat.id, message, {
    })
  })
})
```

The first command is a startup message, which is triggered when a user sends a `/start` message to the bot. The startup message contains a greeting that tells the user which other commands the bot can respond to, in this case, the `/ethereum` command.

When a user sends an `/ethereum` message, the bot first checks for the latest price of ethereum at [CoinGecko](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=ethereum\&vs_currencies=usd), then send it to the user.

### Run Bot Locally

Now that our bot can respond to users if they send it `/start` or `/ethereum` messages, run `npm start` in a terminal window while in the project's root folder to test this functionality.

Send your bot `/start` and `/ethereum` messages in Telegram, and it should respond with the correct messages.

### Polling vs Webhooks

Earlier on, we mentioned that the `bot.launch()` command uses polling, which isn't the best practice when deploying any application to production. Using webhooks is a good alternative to polling, as it ensures our bot receives commands as they are sent by Telegram users, as opposed to constantly _polling_ or asking the Telegram API for them.

Add the code below to the `index.js` file to add a webhook to our bot and comment out the `bot.launch()` line:

```js

expressApp.use(bot.webhookCallback('/secret-path'))
bot.telegram.setWebhook('<YOUR_CAPSULE_URL>/secret-path')

// bot.launch()

expressApp.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on ${port}`));
```

Navigate to the capsule you deployed at the start of this tutorial and copy its domain from the "Details" tab. In the code snippet above, replace `<YOUR_CAPSULE_URL>` with the domain you just copied.

### Deploying the Bot

On Code Capsules, navigate to the "Config" tab of your capsule and add a `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable giving it the value of your bot's access token.

Now, head over to your local development environment and commit your changes if you haven't already. Run `git push` in a terminal window while in the project's root folder, to deploy your bot to production!
