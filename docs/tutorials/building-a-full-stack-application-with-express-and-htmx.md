# Building a Full Stack Application With Express and HTMx

Single page frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue have become the go-to solution for frontend development recently. This shift from traditional multipage websites is mainly due to the lack of interactivity offered by HTML. It’s worth noting, however, that single page applications (SPAs) aren’t a perfect solution, as they introduce an added layer of complexity by installing a host of other dependencies that need to be linked together before deploying your site to production.

This is where a new HTML extension called HTMx enters and shines. HTMx gives traditional HTML sites more interactivity while keeping things simple, as it allows you to make requests from any HTML element and not just `<a>` and `<form>` tags. But this is not HTMx’s only benefit. Other benefits include:

* Making it possible to perform partial page reloads in HTML.
* Support for PUT and DELETE methods in addition to GET and POST.
* Not being limited to click and submit event triggers only.
* Lightweight set up – no additional dependencies need to be installed to get HTMx working.

In this tutorial, we’ll explore the benefits of HTMx by building a full-stack application using Express and HTMx. Our application will be a book recommendation app that supports CRUD functionality. The final app will look a bit like this:

<figure><img src="/gitbook-assets/tutorials/book-app.png" alt="" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview and Requirements

After building our application, you’ll want to deploy it to production, so you can show it to friends and family. You will therefore need the following to complete the tutorial:

* Git set up and installed, and a registered GitHub account
* A [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io/) account
* Node.js installed
* An IDE or text editor of your choice

### Setting up the Project <a href="#setting-up-the-project" id="setting-up-the-project"></a>

With all the requirements in place, we can go ahead and set up our project. Let’s start by creating the project folder.

#### Create Project Folder

Let’s create a folder to house our application’s source code. Run the commands below in the terminal to create the folder and navigate into it.

```
mkdir express-htmx
cd express-htmx
```

From here onwards, the `express-htmx` directory will be referred to as the project’s root folder.

#### Initialize Project

Run the command `npm init` in the project root folder and follow the setup instructions to create a new `node.js` project.

#### Install Dependencies

While still in the root folder, run the command below to install the dependencies we’ll need to build our application:

```
npm i express pug sequelize sqlite3
```

You might notice there’s no dependency for HTMx in our dependency list. This is because it will be added as a script tag inside the head of our HTML template.

#### Initialize an Empty Git Repository

From the project’s root folder, enter the command `git init` to initialize a `git` repository. This will allow you to track changes to your app as you build it.

Create a `.gitignore` file and add the line below to it:

```
/node_modules
```

This excludes the `node_modules` folder from being tracked as you build the app, which is OK since it has files that won’t change.

#### Linking to GitHub

Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository. Then, in your project’s root folder, run the command below from the terminal, replacing `username` and `repository_name` with your own values from GitHub:

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository_name.git
```

This will link your local repository to the one on GitHub.

### Building the HTMx Frontend <a href="#building-the-htmx-frontend" id="building-the-htmx-frontend"></a>

With the set-up complete, we can now begin building our app. We will start with the HTMx frontend, and for this, you need to create a `/views` folder inside the project’s root folder.

Next, create an `index.pug` file inside the `/views` folder, and populate it with the code below:

```
<doctype html>
<html lang='en'>
  <head>
    <title>Book Recommendations</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'>
    <script src='https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.5.0'></script>
    <style>
      body {padding: 20px}
      table {font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;}
      tr.htmx-swapping td {opacity: 0; transition: opacity 0.5s ease-out;}
      td, th {border: 1px solid #383737; text-align: left; padding: 8px;}
      tr:nth-child(even) {background-color: #dddddd;}
    </style>
  </head>
```

There’s not much going on in the code snippet above, except for lines 5 and 6, which are responsible for loading Bootstrap and HTMx into our index page. This gives you the power to build an interactive page just by including the `<script>` tag that links to HTMx, without needing to install any `npm` packages like with most SPAs. This is how HTMx allows you to build sites that are more lightweight compared to SPA frameworks.

The code underneath the `<style>` tag adds CSS to style our frontend to make it more visually appealing. Now let’s add code that will be rendered in the body tag of our page. Copy and paste the code below with the same level of indentation as the `</head>` tag:

```
<body>
  <h1>Book Recommendations</h1>
  <form hx-post="/submit" hx-swap="beforeend" hx-target="#new-book" class="mb-3">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Book Title" name="title" class="form-control mb-3">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Book Author" name="author" class="form-control mb-3">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
  </form>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Book Title</th>
        <th>Book Author</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody id="new-book" hx-target="closest tr" hx-swap="outerHTML swap:0.5s">
      <each book in books>
        <tr>
          <td>#{book.name}</td>
          <td>#{book.author}</td>
          <td>
            <button class="btn btn-primary" hx-get="/get-edit-form/${book.id}">Edit Book</button>
          </td>
          <td>
            <button hx-delete="/delete/${book.id}" class="btn btn-primary">Delete</button>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </each>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</body>
```

There are a couple of attributes here that aren’t used in traditional HTML. Let’s go over them one by one:

* **hx-\[http method]** – Examples of this attribute include `hx-post`, `hx-get`, `hx-put`, and `hx-delete`. This is the HTMx way of denoting what type of request should be sent on form submission or when a request-firing event is triggered. These attributes accept the request route as an argument. In the case of our form, we use the `/submit` route, while the table buttons send requests to the `/delete` and `/get-edit-form` routes.
* **hx-target** – This attribute accepts the `id` of the element you want to update after a successful request or when an event is triggered. Take note of the preceding `#` that’s written before the ID value.
  * You might have noticed that we didn’t use an `id` value in the table, but used a value of closest `tr` instead. This swaps the closest table row with the HTML that will be returned by the request when an action is triggered. The closest row will always be the same row in which an event or request was triggered, either by the “Edit Book” button or the “Delete” button.
* **hx-swap** – The [hx-swap](https://htmx.org/docs/#swapping) attribute allows you to specify how you want to partially reload the page or swap elements with new ones. It updates the UI in the section specified in the `hx-target` attribute.
  * In our form, we used the `beforeend` value to tell HTMx that we want to append the result of the request after the last child in the target element, which is the table with `id=new-book`.
  * In the table, however, we used the `outerHTML` value to denote that we wish to swap the entire `<tr>` element with the returned content.
  * A full list of acceptable `hx-swap` values can be viewed [here](https://htmx.org/docs/#swapping).

### Building the Express Backend <a href="#building-the-express-backend" id="building-the-express-backend"></a>

We can now dive into building the backend of our app. Start by creating an `app/model/` directory from the project root folder and creating a file named `dbconfig.js` in it. This file will contain logic for creating a SQLite database on a persistent file storage Data Capsule on Code Capsules when we deploy our application. Populate the `dbconfig.js` file with the code below:

```
const { Sequelize } = require("sequelize");
const persistent_path = process.env.PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR || ".";

const sequelize = new Sequelize("test-db", "user", "pass", {
  dialect: "sqlite",
  host: persistent_path + "/dev.sqlite",
});

module.exports = sequelize;
```

The value of the `PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable will contain the path to the persistent file storage Data Capsule on Code Capsules. We will use Sequelize as our ORM to make interacting with the database easier.

#### Create a `Book` Model

After creating the database, we have to define the model of objects we’ll be reading and writing to it. Add a file named `book.js` in the `/model` folder and fill it with the code below:

```
// represents the model

const { Model, DataTypes } = require("sequelize");
const sequelize = require("./dbconfig");

class Book extends Model {}

Book.init(
  {
    id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
    name: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
    },
    author: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
    },
  },
  {
    sequelize,
    modelName: "book",
    timestamps: false,
  }
);

module.exports = Book;
```

Our `Book` objects will have three fields for the `id`, `name`, and `author`. The last line exports an instance of the `Book` model, which we’ll use in other project files to perform CRUD operations on the database.

#### Add `App` Routes

The next step is to add the views responsible for executing the CRUD operations we’ll be performing on book objects. Create an `index.js` file in the project root folder and add the following code to it:

```
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const sequelize = require("./app/model/dbconfig");
const Book = require("./app/model/book");

// automatically creating table on startup
sequelize.sync({ force: true }).then(async () => {
  console.log("db is ready...");
});

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Configuring body parser middleware
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.set("view engine", "pug");

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3005;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Service endpoint = http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

In the snippet above, we import the modules our app depends on, initialize an `app` object, and add logic to create a `Books` table in our database when the application first runs.

Let’s add an index route that fetches and returns all `Book` objects from the database when a user visits the landing page. Add the following code to `index.js` above the `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3005;` line:

```
app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  const books = await Book.findAndCountAll();
  return res.render("index", { books: books.rows });
});
```

We use the Sequelize `Book` model object we defined in the `book.js` file to query the database for all book objects in a readable format using the `findAndCountAll()` method and not raw SQL. This is the major benefit of using an ORM to interact with a database.

Next, we’ll add a `/submit` route that will be called when a user submits a new book entry. This route will be responsible for saving and returning the `id` of the recently saved book to the database. Paste the code below into `index.js`:

```
app.post("/submit", async (req, res) => {
  const book = {
    name: req.body.title,
    author: req.body.author,
  };
  await Book.create(book).then((x) => {
    // send id of recently created item
    return res.send(`<tr>
        <td>${req.body.title}</td>
        <td>${req.body.author}</td>
        <td>
            <button class="btn btn-primary"
                hx-get="/get-edit-form/${x.null}">
                Edit Book
            </button>
        </td>
        <td>
            <button hx-delete="/delete/${x.null}"
                class="btn btn-primary">
                Delete
            </button>
        </td>
    </tr>`);
  });
});
```

As HTMx expects an HTML response, the `submit` method responds with an HTML table row that updates the list of books on the frontend. The new entry will be for the recently added book.

Next, let’s add the code for the `/delete` route. Copy and paste the code below:

```
app.delete("/delete/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  await Book.findOne({ where: { id: id } }).then((book) => {
    book.destroy();
    return res.send("");
  });
});
```

The first thing you may have noticed about this route is the `id` query parameter it accepts. This allows us to know which object to delete. After deleting the book, we return an empty string, which causes the row we deleted in the frontend to disappear, as it is swapped for “nothing”.

We now have routes for creating, reading, and deleting books. It’s time to add routes associated with updating book entries to complete our app’s CRUD functionality. Add the code below to `index.js` to add logic for updating book entries to your app:

```
app.get("/get-book-row/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  await Book.findOne({ where: { id: id } }).then((book) => {
    return res.send(`<tr>
        <td>${book.name}</td>
        <td>${book.author}</td>
        <td>
            <button class="btn btn-primary"
                hx-get="/get-edit-form/${id}">
                Edit Book
            </button>
        </td>
        <td>
            <button hx-delete="/delete/${id}"
                class="btn btn-primary">
                Delete
            </button>
        </td>
    </tr>`);
  });
});

app.get("/get-edit-form/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  await Book.findOne({ where: { id: id } }).then((book) => {
    return res.send(`<tr hx-trigger='cancel' class='editing' hx-get="/get-book-row/${id}">
        <td><input name="title" value="${book.name}"/></td>
        <td><input name="author" value="${book.author}"/></td>
        <td>
          <button class="btn btn-primary" hx-get="/get-book-row/${id}">
            Cancel
          </button>
          <button class="btn btn-primary" hx-put="/update/${id}" hx-include="closest tr">
            Save
          </button>
        </td>
      </tr>`);
  });
});

app.put("/update/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  // update book
  await Book.findByPk(id).then((item) => {
    item
      .update({
        name: req.body.title,
        author: req.body.author,
      })
      .then(() => {
        return res.send(`<tr>
            <td>${req.body.title}</td>
            <td>${req.body.author}</td>
            <td>
                <button class="btn btn-primary"
                    hx-get="/get-edit-form/${id}">
                    Edit Book
                </button>
            </td>
            <td>
                <button hx-delete="/delete/${id}"
                    class="btn btn-primary">
                    Delete
                </button>
            </td>
        </tr>`);
      });
  });
});
```

There’s more than one route for the update logic, and we’ll see why shortly. The `/get-edit-form` route is called when a user clicks on the “Edit Book” button on the frontend, and it returns a form for updating the selected book. If the user decides to cancel this action, the `/get-book-row` route is called, and it returns a table row with the unedited book entry.

If the user goes through with updating the book, then the `/update` route is called, and it will update the book based on the `id` supplied to it as a query parameter. When the update is complete, the method returns an HTML table row with the updated book.

#### Add `Start` Script

Code Capsules automatically runs the `npm start` command to start `node` projects. Currently, our project doesn’t have a `start` command, so let’s add one in `package.json`. Modify the `"scripts"` dictionary in the `package.json` file so that it looks like this:

```
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1",
  "start": "node index.js"
},
```

When you’ve added the start script, Code Capsules will be able to automatically run your app when you deploy it.

### Running our App <a href="#running-our-app" id="running-our-app"></a>

Our app is ready to be tested. Navigate to the project’s root folder in a terminal and run the following command: `npm run start`. This should start up a development server on port 3005. Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:3005/` and you should see your app running.

### Add, Commit, and Push Git Changes <a href="#add-commit-and-push-git-changes" id="add-commit-and-push-git-changes"></a>

Let’s add and commit all the files we created to our local repository and then push them to the remote one. Do this by running the commands listed below in a terminal while in the project’s root folder:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "Added book recommendation app files"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Your remote repository will now be up-to-date with your local one.

### Deploy to Code Capsules <a href="#deploy-to-code-capsules" id="deploy-to-code-capsules"></a>

The final step is to deploy our app. Log into your Code Capsules account and link your remote GitHub repository to Code Capsules. Create a persistent storage Data Capsule and a Backend Capsule and bind the two together to deploy the app. You can follow this [reference guide](https://codecapsules.io/tutorial/how-to-set-up-a-persistent-file-data-capsule/) to see how to do so in greater detail.

That’s it! Your “Book Recommendations” app should be live and fully functional now.\\
