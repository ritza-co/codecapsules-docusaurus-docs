# Express + MongoDB

Deploy an Express.js and Mongo application and learn how to host backend code on Code Capsules.

## Setup

Code Capsules connects to GitHub repositories to deploy applications. To follow this guide, you'll need a [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io/) account and a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

To demonstrate how to deploy an Express.js MongoDB application with Code Capsules, we've provided an example application, which you can find on the [Code Capsules GitHub repository](https://github.com/codecapsules-io/demo-express-mongodb).

Sign in to GitHub, and fork the example application by clicking **Fork** at the top-right of your screen and selecting your GitHub account as the destination.

## Create the Capsules

A [Capsule](/platform/capsules/what-is-a-capsule) provides the server for hosting an application on Code Capsules.

Navigate to the Spaces tab and open the Space you'll be using.

Click the yellow **+** button in the bottom left of the screen, select **New Capsule**, and follow the instructions below to create a Database Capsule:

1. Choose **Data Capsule**.
2. Under **Data Type**, select **MongoDB Database Cluster**.
3. Click **Create Capsule**.

Navigate to the Space containing your recently created Data Capsule. Click the yellow **+** button in the bottom left of the screen, select **New Capsule**, and follow the instructions below to create a Backend Capsule:

1. Choose **Backend Capsule**, your Team, and Space.
2. Choose a payment plan.
3. Choose the GitHub repository you forked.
4. Press **Next**.
5. Leave **Run Command** blank.
6. Click **Create Capsule**.

Code Capsules will automatically build your application when you've finished creating the Capsule. While the build is in progress, you can view the log by clicking **View Build Progress** next to the **Building Capsule** message.

Once your application is live, you can view the build log by selecting the **Deploy** tab and clicking the **View build log** link in the **Builds** section.

## Connect the Capsules

After the two capsules have been successfully built, the next step is to connect them. To do this, navigate to the **Config** tab of your Backend Capsule. Scroll down to the **Data Capsule** section and click **View** to view the environment variables from the Data Capsule. Click the `+` next to the `Connection string` variable to create a `DATABASE_URL` environmental variable in your Backend Capsule, which gives access to services and features of your Data Capsule.

## View Application

You can now view the application after the two capsules have been connected. To see how it looks, click on the URL in the **Details** tab.
